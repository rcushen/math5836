  # Part A: Case I- Classification

Imagine yourself as a data scientist and build a neural network model using the given data sets.

## Case I - Classification

### Instructions

Clean the above data sets with data processing code and then prepare them for modelling using neural networks. Build a model using the neural network model either using Keras or scikit-learn in Python or R. Understand the given problem and identify the respective inputs and outputs of the proposed model.

Consider the following steps to build and evaluate the model:

1. Analyse and visualise the given data sets by reporting the distribution of class, distribution of features and any other visualisation you find appropriate.
2. Investigate the effect of Adam and SGD on training and test performance.
3. Investigate the effect of learning and momentum rate for any of the selected data sets.
4. Investigate the effect on a different number of hidden layers (1, 2, 3, 4) with a selected number of hidden neurons for any of the selected data sets.
5. Investigate the effect of different combinations of the number of hidden neurons (eg. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25) for single hidden layer.

Evaluate the best model using a confusion matrix and show ROC and AUC, Precision-Recall curve and F1 Score for the classification problem.

Note that task 2 to 5 would require 10 experimental runs for each case where you report mean and 95% confidence interval. You need to select the appropriate metrics, i.e., for classification report performance on the train and test data set. You are free to you your personal computers for running experiments and uploading the results/code on Ed later.  You must upload code on Ed and ensure code can run on Ed (where N=1) for experiments. Ensure that you demonstrate the use of functions/methods in your code and you are free to separate or clump some of the methods/functions together.
